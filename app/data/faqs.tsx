		question: "How often is the App updated?",
		answer:
			"As a minimum, the congestion status of each beach is updated three times per day at approximately 9am, 1pm and 5pm. The Seafront Ranger Team will update the congestion statuses throughout the day, with more frequent updates when required. The 'Last update' and 'Next update' times can be found at the top of the home page under the 'Notice' section.",
	},
	{
		question: "Is it free to download?",
		answer: "Yes, it is. There are no in-app purchases required. The App can be downloaded from the Google Play and Apple App stores.",
	},
	{
		question: "Which beaches are covered by the App?",
		answer:
			"The App covers the whole of the coastal beaches across Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole only. We have divided them into 24 sections for ease of use; from Sandbanks to Southbourne, Solent Beach to Highcliffe and all other beaches in-between.",
	},
	{
		question: "Why doesn't the App cover other beaches and public areas?",
		answer:
			"The App does not cover the inner harbours at Christchurch and Poole, or any other beaches and public areas within Dorset or the UK. For now, the App is heavily reliant on visual observation from our BCP Seafront Ranger Team. ur team do not patrol these areas and so we cannot provide reliable congestion information at this time.",
	},
	{
		question: "Will the App be extended to cover other beaches in the UK?",
		answer:
			"Not at present, but it could be. Contact your Local Authority and tell them about our BCP Beach Check App. We would be happy to help them.",
	},
	{
		question: "What does the congestion status tell me?",
		answer:
			"The congestion status reflects how busy each of our 24 sections of beach are. It considers the busyness of the zig zags, footpaths, promenades and the beach itself. We are working to include car park availability also.",
	},
	{
		question: "I have a sight impairment. How can distinguish the congestion status of each beach?",
		answer: "",
	},
	{
		question: "Does the App collect my personal details?",
		answer:
			"No, it does not. The App does not ask for any personal details at any time. It does not track your location and does not require any contact details when using the feedback function.",
	},
	{
		question: "How is data collected to update the beach congestion statuses?",
		answer:
			"The App is updated manually based upon weather patterns, footfall data and live CCTV footage in certain areas. The congestion status is determined by the Seafront Ranger Team using the data sources listed but mainly by live observations throughout the day.",
	},
	{
		question: "Is the App in real-time?",
		answer:
			"We're working on that! Currently, the app is manually updated at set times throughout the day with more frequent updates when required. We are working to automate the App so that it can provide real-time congestion updates.",
	},
	{
		question: "What other useful information does the App provide?",
		answer:
			"When you tap on any highlighted section of the beach map, you will be presented with essential information on cycling restrictions, dog exercise and BBQ permissions. Information on whether there are public toilet facilities nearby is also displayed along with whether the beach is lifeguarded.",
	},
